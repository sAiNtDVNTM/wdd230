          48 Wherefore, my beloved brethren, apray unto the Father with all the
          energy of heart, that ye may be filled with this love, which he hath
          bestowed upon all who are true bfollowers of his Son, Jesus Christ;
          that ye may become the sons of God; that when he shall appear we shall
          cbe like him, for we shall see him as he is; that we may have this
          hope; that we may be dpurified even as he is pure. Amen.
